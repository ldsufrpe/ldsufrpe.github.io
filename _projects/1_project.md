State preparation is an essential part of quantum computing and much more complex than its analog in classical
computing. For this reason, it is a topic in quantum computing that has attracted much attention since many algorithms
need to recreate the initial state repeatedly during execution - which can compromise their efficiency. In contrast to
dense states, many relevant states have the property that only a tiny part of the base states have non-zero
coefficients (sparse quantum states). Many quantum algorithms need to prepare initial states or an instance of a
problem. Depending on the problem instance, these states are also sparse; this includes solving quantum linear systems,
for example. The project's main objective is to investigate/propose methods to prepare sparse and dense states more
efficiently and for various purposes.
