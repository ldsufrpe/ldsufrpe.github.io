PhD in Computer Science from the UFPE Informatics Center (2019), Master in Mathematics from UFC (2010), and Graduate in Mathematics from UFRPE (2007). I am currently a professor at the Department of Mathematics at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco. 
I have experience in Discrete Differential Geometry and Quantum Computing. I work on the development of models for quantum transport on curved surfaces, quantum calculus and preparation of quantum states.
