A computational mathematician who studies discrete differential geometry, mathematical software, quantum computing, and applications of mathematics in the life sciences.

My research relies on mathematical software and numerical and computational methods, emphasizing discrete calculus and quantum algorithms.

Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/) (UFPE), Degree in Mathematics from the  [Rural Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufrpe.br/) (UFRPE), and a Master in Mathematics from the [Federal University of Cear√°](https://www.ufc.br/) (UFC).

I am currently an Adjunct Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.dm.ufrpe.br/) at the [Federal Rural University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/). 
I also collaborate with the research group on Quantum Computing at the [UFPE Informatics Center](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/).
